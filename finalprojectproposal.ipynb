    "## Description:\n",
    "+ Flight delay has become widespread in the United States. Nearly one quarter of all flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes. In the United States, the Federdal Aviation Administration has estimated the total cost for flight delay cost 22 billion yearly. Moreover, flight delay can also have indirect effect of lost labor productivity, an opportunity cost of time for travellers, and changes in consumer spending on travel and tourism goods and services.Thus, correctly prediecting flight delays can help airlines to response to potential causes of flight delays and allow travelers to prepare ahead for the further actions.Therefore, this project will build a supervised learning model that predicts airline delay from historical flight data and weather information."
